The ArtPlacer Widget plugin lets you embed the ArtPlacer Widget into your WordPress website with just a few clicks.

== Description ==

Intuitive and fast, the ArtPlacer Widget allows your visitors to visualize how artworks look on walls as soon as they arrive to your website!

Why ArtPlacer?
ArtPlacer allows you to show the relative scale of artworks in relation to other objects or humans, and how the pieces work together, on a wall. Using ArtPlacer you can create three types of Widget buttons: Client Room, Sample Room and Augmented Reality.
• The ArtPlacer Client Room Widget shows how an artwork will come together in a space. It helps collectors to visualize exactly what the original artwork would look like in their actual room.
• The ArtPlacer AR Widget places artworks on surrounding walls in real time. This mobile feature is functional in iOS and Android devices and connects with the ArtPlacer Mobile App.
• The ArtPlacer Sample Room Widget helps to visualize artworks outside the gallery or studio environment and out into the world. Choose from a variety of over 800 pre-set spaces to showcase your art at scale!
